# Predictive-Pest-Management-for-Sustainable-Agriculture-Project
This project's major purpose is to assist farmers in protecting their crops from pests. We use data and technology to determine when pests may attack, allowing farmers to act early and avoid damage. This improves farming efficiency, saves money, and benefits the environment.
